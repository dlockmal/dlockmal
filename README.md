# 👨🏼‍💻 David Lock Malicote 

**`Digital Organizer (Hacker/Dev/Creator/Leader)`**

I'm a leader of information security teams building my versions of the digital future one step at a time. All projects here are built from the ground
up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems. I have several custom scripts and hacks that unfortunately I can't share publicly. 
I have removed several forked repos containing altered code that is no longer relevant.
